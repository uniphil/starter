title: Sycnchronizing OpenDataKE
---

This project, [Education feedback loops in Nairobi slums](http://www.developmentgateway.org/news/development-gateway-grand-challenges-explorations-winner) has an ambitious goal: "combine citizen-generated data with official government data in a way that allows slum dwellers to access and use this information to make decisions to improve their community." The very first question then is how do we combine citizen data (to start, schools locations and properties from OpenStreetMap) with government data (the same, from OpenDataKE).
